	<h2>About the Author</h2>
		<p>I made this story with the scenario of being an undeclared major for the first two years of my college life. The future has a lot to think about, and can be very difficult for people to figure out. Coming out to Michigan State University, didn't seem far, but I was still leaving all of my friends and family behind. Making friends was difficult in large lecture halls, and those that I did meet didn't stay in contact much after the semester ended. One thing that I was always told ever since I left high school was "You have plenty of time to decide you major". Big mistake believing that! So in the meantime, I would take all of my required credits. By the time I got most of those done, I still had no clue of what studies I wanted to focus on. I went towards education in the beginning, and ended up realizing that I don't enjoy teaching all that much. Off a limb, I decided to study Media and Information, only to learn that I wouldn't be able to graduate in the four years that I wanted to, and due to the fact that I took my time taking education classes, I lost some experience that I could have gotten with more Media classes. Now, in my senior year, I'm taking a semester off to make a portfolio for myself, take some time to figure out what I want to do with my life, and hopefully find some work that will give me some field experience.</p>
