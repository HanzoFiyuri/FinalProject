<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I was born in Ann Arbor, MI, and lived with a family of six, with my dad, mom, older brother, older sister, and little brother. I graduated from Skyline High School (Mascot being an Eagle, and yes, it totally sounds like an airport), was on their varsity bowling team, and was once vice president of their anime club. Both were quite fun. Now I'm currently living in an apartment in East Lansing, experiencing new things being at school or at home. Also, waiting for the upcoming cosplay club that's happening this Fall semester. Hoping to meet a lot of new people there.</p>
